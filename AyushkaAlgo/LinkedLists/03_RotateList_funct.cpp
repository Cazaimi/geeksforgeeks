  Rotate a Linked List (Function Problem)
     
  Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer smaller than or equal to length of the linked list. For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40.

  Input:

  In this problem, complete the method which takes two argument: the head of the linked list and int k. We should not read any input from stdin/console.
  The struct Node has a data part which stores the data and a next pointer which points to the next element of the linked list. 
  There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

  Output:
  Rotate the link list from index k and return its new head pointer.


  Note: If you use "Test" or "Expected Output Button" use below example format

  Example:
  Input:
  1
  8
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
  4

  Output:
  5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4

/*
Please note that it's Function problem i.e.
you need to write your solution in the form of Function(s) only.
Driver Code to call/invoke your function would be added by GfG's Online Judge.*/
