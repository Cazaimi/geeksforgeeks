Ok, now let's make some rules. The clock has started ticking. 

Now, I will spend ~10 mins into this.

What happened yesterday was terrible. I was not able to solve th problem, perhaps there were some other distractions as well. 
In any case, what ensued was a complete waste of time. Let's not do that. Let's keep a daily target, and track our progress. How?

1. Excel sheet. Maintain days vs. problems solved. 
2. Be mechanical. Spend 10 mins thinking about a problem. 
	if you figured it out, good. Implement it in the next 20 minutes.
	if you were not able to figure it out, look at the editorial. 
	Spend not more than 15 minutes on the editorial.
	Were you able to implement it? No? Move on. Come back to it later, in leisure time.
	
	What is the time now?
	wow, 4 min.
	
	
OK. Got it? good.

So, worst case = 10 + 15 + 20 = 45 mins
	best case  = 10 + 20      = 30 mins

Speaking of leisure time, if you're not able to solve a problem, sanction some time for it later on.

This could be at night, where you waste time, or on the weekends.

I need to track progress. Let's make a goal:

I will finish Stacks and Queues in 2 days, Tops.

06:47

Then, I will make another target. Let's save a reminder.

Done.
